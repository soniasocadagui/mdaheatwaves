# Heat Wave Impacts on Human Health
## Description

A heat wave is an extended period of scorching weather, and undoubtedly it is becoming more common, severe, and long-lasting as global temperatures rise worldwide [9]. Heat waves are potentially dangerous to human health. Prolonged exposure to excessive warmth makes the human body hot, relying on sweat evaporation to disperse it. If the heat flowing into the body is more than the heat leaving the body, the core temperature will rise to overheat, and the person will be at risk for heat-related illnesses, such as cramps, fainting, exhaustion, stroke, and even death [6].

The immediate effects of high temperatures on physical human health are pretty evident and well-known. However, the knowledge about possible long-term impacts of extreme heat on mental health is still in research, as well as the study of the deterioration of chronic diseases due to exposure to harsh hot weather. Even though there are possible gaps in current research, the early results show heat waves are not just physically harmful but can also harm mental health, alleging an increase in suicide attempts, anxiety disorders, depression, aggressive behaviors, violent crimes, or even a lower cognitive ability [12].

As the expectation is that climate change will raise the global average temperature in the coming years, also heat waves will get even worse [13]. Therefore, addressing the potential impact of soaring temperatures on mental and chronic health conditions is essential to create public health measures to tackle these issues properly in the forthcoming times.
